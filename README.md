# Ants

- Language: Java
- Description: This is a simulation with graphics of Ant foraging behavior using the Processing Library. 


## Background
Ant colonies are a classic example of the concept of emergence, where a collection of entities with simple behavior such as ants, bees, or cells can have complex behaviors in groups.
When an ant finds food while foraging, it lays down a trail of pheromones to signal the food’s location to other ants. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail to the food, and lay their own pheromones. Pheromones fade over time, so once a food source is exhausted and no more ants create new pheromone trails to it ants will stop searching that area. In reality, colonies of ants use a number of different types of pheromones to communicate the location of food, predators, rival colonies, and find their way home. 


## Class Types
### Antworld class
This is the main driver of the program. It uses the Processing library to create a window, then create and update an ant simulation until the user stops the program.

- Sets WORLD_SIZE to set the size of the window in pixels. 



### Food class
An ant has found a food object when it is within a distance of 0.01 from it. When this happens, the ant eats the food object and removes it from AntWorld. This is done by calling the removeFood method of the current instance of AntWorld.



### AntPheromone class
Represents pieces of the pheromone trail left by the ant after it has found food. An ant begins creating pheromones at its position when it finds and eats food, and continues creating pheromones until it has returned to its next. AntPheromones start with 100 strength and decay over time. Once it has reached 0 strength, it is no longer detectable by ants and will be automatically removed from AntWorld.

- Pheromones have creatorID which denotes which ant created that pheromone and how many food that ant has found in total when that pheromone was created. For instance, if a pheromone is created by ant ”6” after finding its 8th food, then the pheromone’s ID should be ”6_8”.



### Ant classes
There are several ant types: 

- Queen Ant: There is only one Queen ant per nest. The queen ant uses food from the nest to create new ants. The type of any the Queen creates is based maintaining a minimum number of each other type of ant, and whether food or enemies have been found recently. 
- Scout Ant: This type of ant cannot carry food or attack enemies, but can move faster than other ants. This ant searches for food and enemies and creates pheromone trails for other ants to follow. 
- Warrior Ant: This type of ant guards the next and follows pheromone trails when enemy ants are found or nearby ants from the same nest are destroyed. This ant cannot carry food but can attack other ants. 
- Harvester Ant: This type of ant follows food pheromone trails and collects food for the nest. 

There are several behaviors of the ant. 

1. We reach the nest with food: if we have food and are within 0.01 of our nest, we should note that we are no longer carrying the food, add a food to the nest, increment how many food we’ve found, and do nothing else. 
2. We are carrying food back to the nest: if we have food but are NOT within 0.01 of our nest, we should drop a new pheromone object at our current location and add it to our nest, THEN move closer to our nest, and do nothing else. 
3. if we DO NOT have food, look for a food in range.
4. We have eaten food: if there is a food in range, check if we are within 0.01 of it. If we are, remove the food from the antWorld, note that we are carrying food, remove all items from excludeIDs, and do nothing else.
5. We are approaching food: if there is a food in range and we are NOT within 0.01 of it, move towards the food’s coordinates and do nothing else. 
6. if we DO NOT have food and there is no food in range, search for pheromones
7. We reached the end of a pheromone trail: and there was no food if we find a pheromone, check if we are within 0.01 of it. If we are, then we’ve reached the end of the pheromone trail and have not found any food. This pheromone trail is not useful to us, so we add its creatorID to our excludeIDs list and do nothing else.
8. We are following a pheromone trail: if we find a pheromone and are NOT within 0.01 of it, move towards the pheromone’s coordinates and do nothing else.
9. We are randomly searching: if we DO NOT have food and there is no food or pheromones in range, move randomly.

### Nest Class
Each nest holds lists contains all of the ants in that nest and all of the pheromones generated by ants in that nest. It also increases in size the more food is dropped off at it. 



## Simulation
- The ants(white dots) are located randomly on the simulator. They move around to search for food(green dots).

- Once an ant finds food, other ants follow the pheromone(red lines).

- The ants continue foraging until no foods are remaining.
